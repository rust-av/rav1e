# ArcSwap

The Rust's [`Arc`] can be used from multiple threads and the count is safely
updated as needed. However, the [`Arc`] itself can't be atomically replaced. To
do that, one needs to place it under a lock.

On the other hand, [`AtomicPtr`] can be replaced atomically, but it's hard to
know when the target can be safely freed.

This is a cross-breed between the two â€’ an [`ArcSwap`] can be seeded with an
[`Arc`] and the [`Arc`] can be simultaneously replaced and read by multiple
threads.

Read [the documentation](https://docs.rs/arc-swap) before using.

## Rust version policy

There's no hard policy yet. However, currently the crate builds with Rust 1.26
and is tested for that. There would have to be a very good reason to increase
the required version.
